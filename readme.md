## Exercise: Four Ways to Retrieve AJAX data

Goal: Build a simple single-page app which pulls random data from an external API. The page should have four buttons, which all do the same thing (retrieve and display a new random datum). Your JavaScript should use four different methods for retrieving data from the external API:

* XMLHttpRequest
* Fetch
* jQuery
* Axios

My example uses the [Ron Swanson Quotes](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes) API.
